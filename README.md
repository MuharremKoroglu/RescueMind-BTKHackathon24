Rescue Mind is an in-house iOS training application developed specifically for emergency call center employees using SwiftUI. In addition to receiving basic training on many emergency cases, the contents and visuals of which are prepared by Gemini, employees can solve tests prepared by Gemini on these situations or manage stress and situations more easily during a call with real-life scenarios. After being greeted with a welcome screen, users are directed to the home screen. Rescue Mind, which is basically positioned on 3 main screens, consists of two main screens. At the top of the page, there is a Card view where the user can follow their progress, and Courses are positioned below this view. There are a total of 20 courses divided into categories. The user, who can filter by selecting the category they want, is directed to the course detail page with a sheet view when they click on the course they want to take. While there is a basic text about the emergency on this page, there are important statistics about the emergency and 3 important steps to be taken in incoming calls related to the case under this text. The user who completes the training continues the progress process by marking the course as completed. The user who has earned the right to take the test with the completed course is directed to the test screen with the “Start the Test” button. When this screen opens, Gemini is informed that it needs to start the test with a specially prepared Prompt. Gemini first gives the user a welcome message and asks what the test is for, the test instructions and the first question in order. The answers given by the user are collected for 5 questions and finally a report prepared according to the answers is presented to the user. With this report, the user can get the test results, points to rework and special recommendations. The scenarios screen is presented to the user with a very simple design. The user can again perform a quick filtering process with a Picker positioned on the navigation bar. The user who selects the scenario they want to prepare is directed to the scenario case study screen. On this screen, as in the test screen, Gemini is informed that they need to start the scenario with a specially prepared prompt. After the welcome and instructions, Gemini plays the role of a casualty who calls the emergency call center. The user is expected to collect the necessary information in 5 steps and send the help team. After step 5, Gemini compiles the user's responses into a report, indicating the emergency response time and how the user can better manage the situation. The application ends with the Settings screen, where profile and medical details can be accessed and general application settings can be made.
